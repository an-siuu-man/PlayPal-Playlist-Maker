# PlayPal Playlist Maker

## What it is
PlayPal is a web app built on Django web framework which gives the user a list of ten songs based on the choice of Artist and Year of Release. 

## How to run it
It isn't hosted on an online domain yet, but you can still run it locally on your computer provided you have Django preinstalled. If you do, then clone this repo on your system, go to this directory: `clone_directory/music_app/music_app` and run this command:

`$ python manage.py runserver`

Your console should show you a localhost link, if the execution was successful. Then hold Ctrl and click on the link. Does it show an error page? OH NOO!! Haha, no problems. Just go to the URL bar and add the word 'playpal' after the link. And voila! You can use this app. Happy coding!
